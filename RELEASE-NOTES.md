    - Change default `MetricNamer` implementation to one that is friendlier to re-using superclass gauges in multiple child classes. The previous behavior is still available as `DeclaringClassMetricNamer`.
    - Change `MetricNamer.getNameForGauge` to take an additional parameter to support the superclass logic above.
    - Add Animal Sniffer to build to ensure that only JDK6 types are used.

    - Update to Gradle 3.1
    - Updated dependencies: SLF4J 1.7.21, Guice 4.1.0
    - Allow customization in how annotations are resolved for a method. The default is the previous behavior (only looks on the method itself), but implementations for looking on the class and combining multiple resolvers are provided.
    - `MetricsInstrumentationModule` is now constructed builder-style.
- 3.1.4
    - Switch to releasing in bintray
    - Remove superclass traversal when looking for annotated methods to intercept because AOP on superclass methods doesn't appear to work anyway
    - Switch build to Gradle
    - License under COIL
    - Add ability to have non-public @Gauge methods anywhere in the type hierarchy of an injected type
