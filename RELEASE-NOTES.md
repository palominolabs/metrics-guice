    - Update to Guice 4.2.2 and Metrics 4.1.0
- 4.0.0
    - Build system updates; update Gradle to 4.6
    - Update to Metrics 4.0.2
    - Update to Java 8
- 3.3.0
    - Change default `MetricNamer` implementation to one that is friendlier to re-using superclass gauges in multiple child classes. The previous behavior is still available as `DeclaringClassMetricNamer`.
    - Change `MetricNamer.getNameForGauge` to take an additional parameter to support the superclass logic above.
    - Add Animal Sniffer to build to ensure that only JDK6 types are used.
    - Update to Gradle 4.0.1
- 3.2.2
    - Update to Metrics 3.2.3
    - Update to Gradle 4.0
- 3.2.1
    - Update to Metrics 3.2 and SLF4J 1.7.25
    - Update to Gradle 3.4
- 3.2.0
    - Update to Gradle 3.1
    - Updated dependencies: SLF4J 1.7.21, Guice 4.1.0
    - Allow customization in how annotations are resolved for a method. The default is the previous behavior (only looks on the method itself), but implementations for looking on the class and combining multiple resolvers are provided.
    - `MetricsInstrumentationModule` is now constructed builder-style.
- 3.1.4
    - Switch to releasing in bintray
    - Remove superclass traversal when looking for annotated methods to intercept because AOP on superclass methods doesn't appear to work anyway
    - Switch build to Gradle
    - License under COIL
    - Add ability to have non-public @Gauge methods anywhere in the type hierarchy of an injected type
    - Updated dependencies: Metrics 3.1.2, SLF4J 1.7.12, Guice 4.0
- 3.1.3
    - Add support for `@Counted`
    - Move metric name creation into `MetricNamer` for easy customization
    - Move AdminServletModule into [metrics-guice-servlet](https://github.com/palominolabs/metrics-guice-servlet)
- 3.1.2
    - Make injection listeners public
    - Depend on Metrics 3.1.0
    - Tweak metric naming to avoid duplicate names for different metrics
- 3.1.1
    - Allow specifying a custom matcher
- 3.1.0
    - Don't create MetricRegistry, HealthCheckRegistry, or JmxReporter for the user. This makes it easier to integrate with existing systems that already have instances that should be used.
    - Rename InstrumentationModule to MetricsInstrumentationModule
    - Update to SLF4J
- 3.0.2
    - Update to Metrics 3.0.2
- 3.0.1
    - Update to Jackson 2.0.2
    - Update to Metrics 3.0.1
